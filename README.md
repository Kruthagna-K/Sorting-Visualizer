# Sorting-Visualizer
Web visualization tool used for visualizing various sorting algorithms.
Sorting visualizer is a data structure and algorithm project.Created a web application using HTML,CSS,Java Script to visualize how various sorting algorithm works.
# Problem statement
The motivation behind to develop this project is that, we learn't so many sorting algorithms but often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm.May be because we are unable to visualize how they work.So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is Sorting visualization.
# Design
 created a web user interface which allows users to select the sort algorithms,the array size,and speed of the visualization. The visualization is done using small rectangular boxes created with varying lengths and colour of the segments.
 
 colours of visualization-
  -  Unsorted elements- Blue 
  *  Selection and comparision- Red
  +  Selection of elements- Yellow
  -  Sorted elements- Green
  
# Working
- Selection of an algorithm and then click on sort.

+ Adjustments in length of array and sorting speed can be done.

* Generates new array when clicked on a new length/size of array.

- After this, based on the sorting algorithm chosen, that particular logic is applied and it proceeds to sort the given list of elements.

* This visualization tool, represents in the form of animation, the process of sorting, each step by step, it shows the progress in its process.

+ For example, if we consider bubble sort, there is comparison between each of elements and swapping between elements takes place and arranges it in ascending/descending order and all this is visually represented on the screen.

- After the completion of sorting process, the final result will be displayed, providing the sorted array.

# Proposed system
  Along with the existing system we also faced a challenge in adding features(The speed of visualization and space/time complexity)that gives really best functionality to the system.
